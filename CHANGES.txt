2.1.1 (2014-02-04)
------------------

This is a patch release which actually allows upgrading to 2.1.x with the
instructions given below in the `2.1.0` sections. When upgrading from 2.0.0
to 2.1.x, simply jump to 2.1.1 directly by doing `git checkout 2.1.1`.

Changes:

- Make sure the `src/adhocracy/alembic/versions` directory actually exists in
  order to make `bin/paster setup-app ...` work.

- Update some dependencies.

- Fix search box placeholder for instances with quotes in title. (#740)


2.1.0 (2014-02-04)
------------------

This upgrade only splits the SQLAlchemy-related changes from the 2.0.0 release
in order to make sure all migrations are executed and the database remains in
a consistent state.

Changes:

- Update SQLAlchemy from 0.7.10 to 0.9.1.

- Switch from sqlalchemy-migrate to Alembic. (#219)


Upgrade instructions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you haven't upgraded for a long time (say six months or more), it's best to
delete ``parts``, ``eggs``, ``python/python-2.7`` and ``python/parts``
directories and rebuild everything according to ``INSTALLATION.rst``.

In any case, don't upgrade to 2.1.0 in one go, but upgrade to 2.0.0 first by
running::

    git checkout 2.0.0
    bin/buildout
    bin/paster setup-app etc/adhocracy.ini --name=content

And upgrade to 2.1.0 in a second step::

    git checkout 2.1.0
    bin/buildout
    bin/paster setup-app etc/adhocracy.ini --name=content

This makes sure the remaining sqlalchemy-migration based migrations are
executed in the first step, and the Alembic environment is initialized properly
in the second step.


2.0.0 (2014-02-03)
------------------

- Start doing releases using semantic versioning (#77). This release's
  changelog contains many changes from the past two years, but rather
  incomplete.

- Allow to list norms in a tiled fashion. (#714)

- Add container pages. These special norms act as containers of other norms.
  (#709)

- Proposal descriptions can now be shown directly in proposal lists. (#733)

- It is now possible to translate the English source strings through Transifex
  as it is done in all other languages. In Transifex, the `en_GB` language
  is used as the "translated" English langauage in contrast to the "source"
  English langauage and doesn't imply that british English shall be used.
  (#102)

- Automatically crop and center uploaded images (logos etc) to the desired
  size. (#711)

- Badges can now be managed in context. (#713)

- Add images and long description texts to categories. Categories can now be
  listed and individually displayed, each showing all assigned proposals.
  (#695)

- Added user import script. (#649)

- We redesigned the instance settings. The most notable change is the added
  possibility to select presets on instance creation. (#680)

  The user import and massmessage services have been moved.  They can be found
  on the members index and instance overview, respectively.

- It is now possible to follow instances. (#655)

- All milestones now must have a date. (#658)

- Added installation option to freeze the complete installation. (#289)

- It is possible to select whether other users can edit a proposal.
  We added an instance option to set the default value of that option. (#632)

- a11y improvements.

- Added replay notification script, which recreates notifications inside the
  database which would have been created before notifications were stored in
  the database. (#624)

- We completely redesigned the user profile (#430) and dashboard (#429): User
  can upload an avatar now (#641) and view notifications online.

- Email texts are now wrapped at 78 characters per line. Long links are
  preserved. (#593)

- Added travis configuration which automatically builds Adhocracy using
  build.sh and runs the test suite.

- It is now possible to assign user badges in user import.
  It is also possible to define additional variables which can be used in
  the welcome email.

- Added an installation option to redirect to an instance instead of showing
  the front page. This is useful for single-instance installations. (#431)

- New comment design.

- Subnorms can now be displayed as sections. This way you can add a large
  document consisting of multiple sections and have each of these sections
  discussed separately.

- It is now possible to show all open proposals in the proposal list of future
  milestones. For milestones in the past, this doesn't have any effect. (#562)

  This will be used in the following scenario:

  - There's regular (offline) board meetings. These are entered as milestones.
    During a meeting, the board shall work on as many of the highest rated,
    non-frozen proposals as time permits.
  - All covered proposals will be assigned to the respective milestone, marked
    as frozen and badged as "implemented" (or whatever).
  - All not covered proposals will be covered in successive meetings.

- It is now possible to freeze single proposals. (#559)

- Overlays have their own urls now, so you can link to them. (#553)

- Add warning to users of unsupported browsers. (#111)

- Better user settings layout. (#174)

- Allow footer customization through static URLs. (#472)

- Add custom "show more" markdown extension. (#120)

- build.sh now has Fedora support

- Refactor all CSS and some of the templates to make development and
  theming easier. We also switched to SCSS.

- Added varnish reverse proxy [joka]

- Readd bin/test to run tests (wrapper for py.test) [joka]

- Update python from 2.7.4 to 2.7.5. Please rebuild python:

    * cd python
    * bin/buildout

  [joka]

- Use pytest testrunner instead of nose. (#343)

- Add shibboleth based authentication. (#359)

- Allow to disable tutorials installation-wide. (#54)

- Update buildout from 1.7 to 2.1.0 (#241). Rerun buildout with::

      bin/buildout -n

  If you have versions conflicts with distribute delete the old one::

      rm -r eggs/distribute..".

  [joka]

- The default way to isolate your python environment is now to compile
  python and PIL now instead of using virtualenv::

    Upgrade manual installation:
    ----------------------------

    Checkout python buildout

    * git submodule init
    * git submodule update

    Compile python:

    * cd python
    * python boostrap.py && bin/buildout

    Reinstall Adhocracy:

    * cd ../
    * rm -rf eggs/*
    * bin/python bootstrap.py
    * bin/buildout

    Upgrade build.sh:
    -----------------

    * rm -rf eggs/*
    * sh build.sh -u
    * sh build.sh -s

    [joka]

- Add controversy sorting method to proposals. (#258)

- Allow to hide voting lists from the UI. (#189)

- Badges with thumbnails. (#191)

- Option to disable registration. (#43)

- Login via email address

- Hierarchical categories. (#95)

- Formatted norms. (#192)

- Replace RabbitMQ/amqp with redis/rq (#220). This means that you have to
  provide a working redis instance if you want to use asyncronous
  jobs (highly recommended in production).
  The background process that processes the jobs is renamed from
  'background' to 'worker'. You can call it with
  `bin/paster --plugin=adhocracy worker -c etc/adhocracy.ini`

  Configuration changes:

  * dropped: adhocracy.amqp.* settings are not required anymore.
  * new: adhocracy.redis.host: An IP address redis can bind to
    (not a hostname!)
  * new: adhocracy.redis.port: The port redis will open
  * new: adhocracy.redis.queue: The queue name

- Mandatory email validation. (#142)

- Invisible badges. (#116)

- Instance-based user rating sorting. (#190)

- Disallow multiple usernames with only case differences. (#171)

- Dashboard style instance overview page. (#90)

- Support path based instances instead of subdomain only. (#62)

- Feedback instance pull in form. (#88)

- Lamson mailserver dummy for development purposes.

- Added facet search to the instance listing. The listing is based on solr now,
  please reindex. [joka]

- Instances can have badges now. To create instance badges use the
  site-administration -> badges form. To assign badges use the
  instance listing. [joka]

- New config option "adhocracy.registration.email.blacklist" that
  accepts a whitespace seperated list of email address and
  blocks registrations with those. Dots will be stripped before
  the test (to catch gmail addresses where dots are ignored by gmail).
  [csenger]

- New config option "adhocracy.listings.instance.sorting" that makes
  the sort options for the instance listing configurable. This
  possible values are: OLDEST, NEWEST, ACTIVITY and ALPHA. [csenger]

- Permission change: When we test the 'norm.create' permission
  (permission to create Norms/Topics/Themen we do no longer
  restrict it to users who also have 'instance.admin'. The main
  permission we check now is 'page.create'.

  Please check the permission 'page.create' in your permission
  settings (<base_url>/admin -> Permissions). [csenger]

- Give the users the option to permanently activate the twitter,
  facebook or google+ buttons. Save the setting in a wildcard
  subdomain cookie so it is valid across all instances.

  This requires a updated js.socialshareprivacy to work with
  our auth cookie. [csenger]

- Add the possibility to overwrite templates in <adhocracy.site>/templates
  directory (like it's possible for static resources and static pages already.
  New templates there need a server restart to be picked up.
  [csenger]

- Deliver (almost) all resources with fanstatic. [csenger]

- Delegateables can have category badges. [joka]

- Instances can have badges, they are only valid inside that instance. [joka]
