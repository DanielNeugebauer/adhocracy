adhocracy Changelog
===================

2.0
---

- added user import script

- We redesigned the instance settings. Most notably it is now
  possible to select presets on instance creation.

  The user import and massmessage services have been moved
  and can now be found on the members index and instance overview,
  respectively.

- it is now possible to follow instances

- all milestones now must have a date milestones

- added installation option to freeze the complete installation

- It is possible to select wether other users can edit a proposal.
  We added an instance option to set the default value of that option.

- slight a11y improvements

- added replay notification script

- We completely redesigned the user profile and dashboard. User now can upload
  an avatar.

- email are no wrapped

- added travis configuration

- It is now possible to assign user badges in user import.
  It is also possible to define additional variables which can be used in
  the welcome email.

- Added an installation option to redirect to an instance instead of showing
  the frnt page. This is useful for single-instance installations.

- new comment design

- Subnorms can now be desiplayed as sections. This way you can have a large
  document consisting of multiple sections where each of these sections
  can be discussed separately.

- It is now possible to show all open proposals in the proposal list of future
  milestones. For milestones in the past, this doesn't have any effect.

  This will be used in the following scenario:

  - There's regular (offline) board meetings. These are entered as milestones.
    During a meeting, the board shall work on as many of the highest rated,
    non-frozen proposals as time permits.
  - All covered proposals will be assigned to the respective milestone, marked
    as frozen and badged as "implemented" (or whatever).
  - All not covered proposals will be covered in successive meetings.

- it is now possible to freeze single proposals

- overlays now have their own urls so you can link to them

- setup.sh now has Fedora support

- Refactor all CSS and some of the templates to make development and
  theming easier. We also switched to SCSS.

- many bugfixes

  [joka]

- Replace RabbitMQ/amqp with redis/rq. This means that you have to
  provide a working redis instance if you want to use asyncronous
  jobs (highly recommended in production).
  The background process that processes the jobs is renamed from
  'background' to 'worker'. You can call it with
  `bin/paster --plugin=adhocracy worker -c etc/adhocracy.ini`

  Configuration changes:

  * dropped: adhocracy.amqp.* settings are not required anymore.
  * new: adhocracy.redis.host: An IP address redis can bind to
    (not a hostname!)
  * new: adhocracy.redis.port: The port redis will open
  * new: adhocracy.redis.queue: The queue name

- Added facet search to the instance listing. The listing is based on solr now,
  please reindex. [joka]

- Instances can have badges now. To create instance badges use the
  site-administration -> badges form. To assign badges use the
  instance listing. [joka]]

- New config option "adhocracy.registration.email.blacklist" that
  accepts a whitspace seperated list of email address and
  blocks registrations with those. Dots will be stripped before
  the test (to catch gmail addresses where dots are ignored by gmail).
  [csenger]

- New config option "adhocracy.listings.instance.sorting" that makes
  the sort options for the instance listing configurable. This
  possible values are: OLDEST, NEWEST, ACTIVITY and ALPHA. [csenger]

- Permission change: When we test the 'norm.create' permission
  (permission to create Norms/Topics/Themen we do no longer
  restrict it to users who also have 'instance.admin'. The main
  permission we check now is 'page.create'.

  Please check the permission 'page.create' in your permission
  settings (<base_url>/admin -> Permissions). [csenger]
- Give the users the option to permanently activate the twitter,
  facebook or google+ buttons. Save the setting in a wildcard
  subdomain cookie so it is valid across all instances.

  This requires a updated js.socialshareprivacy to work with
  our auth cookie. [csenger]
- Add the possibility to overwrite templates in <adhocracy.site>/templates
  directory (like it's possible for static resources and static pages already.
  New templates there need a server restart to be picked up.
